# Budgetr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

## Purpose

I like apps like [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) that help track spending, but lots of my spending comes from split bills.
Mint makes this really hard track, since half the time it looks like I'm spending way too much on a meal, while it doesn't
see the venmo's/Zelle's as spending on the same things. Budgetr is designed to let you compensate for this. You can put your
own transactions into the app and track your spending more accurately.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
